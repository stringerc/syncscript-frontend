## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Verify Security Configurations
```bash
# Check that all security files are in place
ls -la SECURITY_*.md
ls -la security-*.js
ls -la middleware/security.js
ls -la src/utils/security.js
```

### Step 2: Update Package.json Dependencies
```bash
# Add security-related dependencies
npm install express-rate-limit helmet cors
npm install --save-dev @types/express-rate-limit
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Commit all security changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement comprehensive security framework

- Enhanced security headers with CSP
- Multi-tier rate limiting
- Security monitoring and logging
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive audit framework
- 10/10 All-Star Cyber Defense implementation"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Verify Security Headers
After deployment, verify security headers are working:
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://syncscript.vercel.app/dashboard

# Expected headers:
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
# X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
# Content-Security-Policy: [comprehensive CSP]
```

### Step 5: Test Security Controls
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do curl -X POST https://syncscript.vercel.app/api/test; done

# Test input validation
curl -X POST https://syncscript.vercel.app/api/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>"}'

# Test authentication
curl -X GET https://syncscript.vercel.app/api/protected \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Security Headers Verification
- [ ] CSP header present and configured
- [ ] HSTS header with preload directive
- [ ] X-Frame-Options set to SAMEORIGIN
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options set to nosniff
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection enabled

### 2. Rate Limiting Verification
- [ ] API endpoints respect rate limits
- [ ] Authentication endpoints protected
- [ ] File upload limits enforced
- [ ] DDoS protection active

### 3. Authentication Verification
- [ ] MFA enforcement working
- [ ] Session timeout functioning
- [ ] JWT token validation
- [ ] Role-based access controls

### 4. Monitoring Verification
- [ ] Security events being logged
- [ ] Authentication attempts tracked
- [ ] API access monitored
- [ ] Error handling secure

## Security Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Authentication Events**
   - Successful logins
   - Failed login attempts
   - MFA usage
   - Session timeouts

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limit violations
   - Input validation failures
   - Authorization failures
   - Suspicious patterns

3. **System Security**
   - Security header compliance
   - SSL/TLS certificate status
   - Vulnerability scan results
   - Backup success rates

### Alerting Thresholds
- **Critical:** > 10 failed auth attempts in 5 minutes
- **High:** > 5 rate limit violations in 1 minute
- **Medium:** > 3 input validation failures in 1 minute
- **Low:** Any security policy violation

## Incident Response Procedures

### Level 1: Automated Response
- Rate limiting violations â†’ Temporary IP blocking
- Input validation failures â†’ Request rejection
- Authentication failures â†’ Account lockout
- Suspicious patterns â†’ Enhanced monitoring

### Level 2: Manual Response
- Multiple failed auth attempts â†’ Security team notification
- Unusual API usage patterns â†’ Investigation
- Data access anomalies â†’ Access review
- System anomalies â†’ Incident response team

### Level 3: Escalated Response
- Potential data breach â†’ CISO notification
- System compromise â†’ Full incident response
- Compliance violation â†’ Legal team notification
- Customer impact â†’ Executive notification
