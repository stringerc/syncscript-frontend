# 🐦 IAOB: Canary Deployment Plan

**Progressive Rollout Strategy**  
**Owner:** Feature-Flag Orchestrator + Release Captain  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks from 0% → 100%  
**Last Updated:** October 13, 2025

## 🎯 CANARY PHILOSOPHY

**Deploy to a small % of users first, monitor health, expand progressively.**

**Benefits:**
- Limit blast radius (1% vs 100%)
- Early detection of issues
- Data-driven rollout decisions
- Easy rollback (just decrease %)

## 🚦 AUTOMATED HEALTH GATES

### **Gate Logic**

```typescript
interface HealthGate {
  metric: string;
  threshold: number;
  window: string;
  action: 'rollback' | 'pause' | 'alert';
}

const gates: HealthGate[] = [
  {
    metric: 'error_rate',
    threshold: 0.01,      // 1%
    window: '5min',
    action: 'rollback'    // Auto-rollback
  },
  {
    metric: 'p95_latency',
    threshold: 3000,      // 3s
    window: '10min',
    action: 'pause'       // Stop rollout, investigate
  },
  {
    metric: 'crash_rate',
    threshold: 0.001,     // 0.1%
    window: '5min',
    action: 'rollback'
  }
];
```

**Automated Actions:**
- **Rollback:** Decrease flag to previous %
- **Pause:** Stop increasing, investigate
- **Alert:** Notify team, manual decision

## 📊 MONITORING DASHBOARD

```
Canary Rollout: backend_integration

Current: 15% (1,234 / 8,234 users)
Started: Oct 13, 04:00 AM
Next Step: 30% (scheduled Oct 15, 10:00 AM)

Health Status: ✅ GREEN

Error Rate:
  Canary (15%): 0.3% ⚠️ (slightly elevated)
  Baseline (85%): 0.2% ✅
  Delta: +0.1% (acceptable)

Latency (p95):
  Canary: 1.8s ✅
  Baseline: 0.5s ✅
  Delta: +1.3s (expected - backend calls)

User Feedback:
  Positive: 12
  Negative: 2
  Neutral: 5
  Sentiment: 73% positive

SLO Compliance:
  Availability: 99.95% ✅
  Error Rate: 0.3% ✅ (within SLO)
  Latency: 1.8s ✅ (within SLO)

Decision: ✅ PROCEED TO 30%
