### **WP-ENG-01: Instantaneous Energy Recalibration** üö® PRIMARY KPI

**Owner:** Frontend Lead + Backend Lead  
**Priority:** **P0 (MUST-HAVE)** - Blocks primary north-star KPI  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Timeline:** Week 1-2 (6 person-days)

**Scope:**
Ensure energy level recalibrates automatically and instantly (<200ms) after task completion, with visible feedback to user.

**Why (Addresses):**
- ENG-H-001: Primary KPI blocker
- If energy is stale, suggestions are wrong, entire value prop fails

**Impact:**
- **KPI:** Enables Energy-Matched Completion Rate to reach 90%
- **User Value:** Suggestions always based on current energy (not yesterday's)
- **Business:** Primary value proposition works as intended

**Dependencies:**
- None (foundational feature)
- **Blocks:** WP-PERS-02 (context-aware AI needs real-time energy)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
```
GIVEN user at energy level 3 completes a medium-energy task (requirement: 3)
WHEN they click "Complete" checkbox
THEN within 200ms:
  - Energy recalibrates to 3.5 (formula: 3 + 0.5 completion bonus)
  - Header energy number animates 3 ‚Üí 3.5
  - Emblem charge calculates and displays +20‚ö°
  - Next AI suggestion updates based on energy 3.5
THEN user perceives update as "instant"
AND over 30 days, energy-matched completion rate reaches 85-90%
AND performance monitoring confirms <200ms for 95% of completions
```

**Risks:**
- **Performance:** Recalculation might be slow if complex
  - *Mitigation:* Optimize algorithm, use Web Workers if needed
- **Accuracy:** Formula might need tuning
  - *Mitigation:* A/B test multiple formulas, validate with user surveys

**Estimated Effort:** 6 person-days
- Performance audit current system: 0.5 days
- Algorithm optimization (if needed): 2 days
- Real-time suggestion update: 2 days
- UI animation polish: 1 day
- Testing & validation: 0.5 days

**Experiment Plan:** See `/plans/wps/WP-ENG-01/exp.md`  
**Telemetry:** See `/plans/wps/WP-ENG-01/events.md`  
**Acceptance Tests:** See `/plans/wps/WP-ENG-01/acceptance.md`

**Gates:**
- [ ] Intent: KPI confirmed (Energy-Matched 90%)
- [ ] Journey: Evidence attached (performance tests)
- [ ] System: Algorithm documented, performance budget allocated
- [ ] Reality: User testing validates "feels instant" (‚â•90%)
- [ ] Integrity: WCAG AA (animations respect reduced-motion), CWV maintained
- [ ] Evidence: Performance monitoring instrumented, rollback plan ready

### Rollback Plan (Per WP)

**Kill Switch Location:** Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Environment Variables  
**Rollback Time:** <5 minutes (toggle flag, redeploy)  
**Monitoring:** Real-time dashboard with alerts

**Auto-Rollback Triggers:**
- Performance regression >10%
- KPI drop >5%
- Error rate >1%
- User complaints >10 in 24 hours

### Communication Plan

**If Rollback Needed:**
- In-app notification: "Feature temporarily disabled for improvements"
- Email (if affected users): "We're optimizing X feature based on your feedback"
- ETA for re-launch: "Back in 2-3 days with improvements"
