## 1. Scope & Jobs-To-Be-Done

### Primary Jobs
When users evaluate or use SyncScript compared to competitors, they are trying to:

1. **Find features they need** - Users want to discover capabilities without hunting through menus
2. **Understand what makes SyncScript different** - Users need to know "Why use this instead of Notion/Todoist?"
3. **Get table-stakes features** - Users expect baseline productivity features (all competitors have)
4. **Experience signature differentiators** - Users want unique value they can't get elsewhere

### User Segments Affected
- **Trial Users** (5% of visitors, high churn risk)
  - Evaluating vs. competitors
  - Churn if can't find features or see differentiation
  
- **New Users** (onboarding, first 7 days)
  - Feature discovery crucial for activation
  - Current: Only 40% discover 10+ features

- **All Users** (retention)
  - Continued discovery drives engagement
  - Competitive threats require clear differentiation

### Success Metrics (from North-Star)
- **Feature Discovery Rate:** Current: **40%** ‚Üí Target: **75%**
  - Definition: % of users who use 10+ features in first 30 days
- **Trial ‚Üí Paid Conversion:** Current: ~18% ‚Üí Target: **30%** (if differentiation clear)
- **Competitive Win Rate:** Current: Unknown ‚Üí Target: **60%** chosen over alternatives

---

## 2. Current State (What Users See Today)

### Onboarding Flow (First 7 Days)

**Current Experience:**
1. User signs up
2. Welcome modal: "Welcome to SyncScript!"
3. Dashboard appears with ALL 105+ features visible
4. User overwhelmed
5. User discovers features through:
   - Random exploration (inefficient)
   - Command Center (if they find it)
   - Accident (clicking around)
6. After 30 days: Only 40% have used 10+ features

**Pain Points:**
- ‚ùå **Feature overload:** 105 features shown at once
- ‚ùå **No progressive disclosure:** Advanced features not hidden initially
- ‚ùå **No guided tour:** Users left to explore alone
- ‚ùå **No "aha moments":** Signature features (energy matching) not highlighted
- ‚ùå **Low discovery:** 60% of users never find key features

**Evidence:**
- **Analytics:** 40% feature discovery rate
- **User testing (Oct 10, new user):** Took 12 minutes to find Kanban view
- **Support tickets:** "Where is X feature?" asked 23 times in 30 days
- **Quote:** *"I know there are tons of features, but I can't find them all"*

---

### Competitive Comparison Flow

**User's Mental Model:**
"Is SyncScript better than Notion/Todoist/Motion?"

**What They Compare:**
1. **Feature checklist:** Does it have what I need?
2. **Unique value:** What can ONLY SyncScript do?
3. **Ease of use:** Can I figure it out?
4. **Price:** Is it worth it?

**Current SyncScript Positioning:**
- ‚úÖ **Feature count:** 105+ (MOST in market)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Feature discovery:** Only 40% (WORST among leaders)
- ‚úÖ **Unique value:** Energy matching (ONLY one)
- ‚ùå **Clarity:** Users don't realize it's unique
- ‚úÖ **Price:** Competitive

**Gap:** Features exist but users can't find them OR don't understand differentiation

## 4. Gaps & Risks (Ranked by Severity)

### üî¥ HIGH SEVERITY

#### [PAR-H-001] Feature Discovery Only 40% - 60% of Users Miss Key Features

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL**  
**Impact:** Users don't find features they'd love, think SyncScript is simpler than it is, churn to competitors with fewer (but more discoverable) features.

**Root Cause:**
- **105+ features shown at once** (overwhelming)
- **No progressive disclosure** (advanced features not hidden)
- **No guided tour** (users left to explore alone)
- **No contextual tips** ("Try Kanban view for this project!")
- **No templates** (Notion has 1000+ templates for discovery)

**Evidence:**
1. **Analytics (brutal):**
   - Only 40% of users discover 10+ features in first 30 days
   - **60% of users** never discover signature features like:
     - Kanban view (only 38% usage)
     - Gantt chart (only 15% usage)
     - Mind map (only 12% usage)
     - Advanced analytics (only 25% usage)
   - **Comparison:** Notion's template gallery increases discovery to 72%

2. **New user testing (Oct 10, 3 participants, first-time users):**
   - Task: "Find the Kanban view for this project"
   - Time: 3 min, 8 min, 12 min (average: 7.7 minutes!)
   - Quote: *"I clicked everywhere. Finally found it in the view switcher, but that wasn't obvious."*

3. **Exit surveys (past 90 days, 47 churned users):**
   - 12 users (26%) cited: "Didn't have features I needed"
   - **Reality:** SyncScript HAD those features, users just didn't find them!
   - Example: User wanted Gantt chart ‚Üí churned ‚Üí SyncScript HAS Gantt chart ü§¶

4. **Support tickets:**
   - "How do I X?" where X is an existing feature: 41 tickets in 30 days
   - Users asking for features that already exist!

**User Impact:**
- **Value unrealized:** Users pay for 105 features, use 8
- **Churn:** Users leave thinking platform is limited
- **Revenue loss:** Could upsell premium if users discovered advanced features
- **NPS impact:** Users rate platform lower than actual capability

**Ties to KPI:**
- **Feature Discovery Rate:** 40% ‚Üí 75% target
- **THE primary gap for this pod**

**Financial Impact:**
- 26% of churn is discoverable (users wanted existing features)
- Estimated revenue loss: $23K/month in prevented churn
- Upsell opportunity: Advanced features could drive Premium tier adoption

---

#### [PAR-H-002] Signature Differentiators Hidden - Users Don't Know What Makes SyncScript Unique

**Severity:** üî¥ **HIGH**  
**Impact:** Users don't understand "Why SyncScript instead of Todoist?" ‚Üí Choose based on familiarity (competitors win)

**Root Cause:**
- **Energy matching** exists but isn't prominent/explained
- **Emblems** exist but feel like "bonus" not core value
- **Marketing:** Features listed, but "so what?" unclear

**Evidence:**
1. **Trial user interview (Oct 9, 3 evaluating users):**
   - Question: "What makes SyncScript different from Todoist?"
   - User 1: *"Um... it has more features?"* (vague)
   - User 2: *"The energy thing, I guess? But I don't really use it."*
   - User 3: *"Not sure, it seems similar to my current app."*
   - **None could articulate clear differentiation!**

2. **Positioning test:**
   - Showed users SyncScript vs Notion vs Todoist vs Motion
   - Asked: "Which would you choose and why?"
   - **Results:**
     - Notion: 35% (familiar, all-in-one)
     - Todoist: 28% (simple, focused)
     - Motion: 22% (AI scheduling is clear differentiator)
     - **SyncScript: 15%** (unclear value prop)

3. **Energy matching** (THE differentiator) visibility:
   - Only 52% of active users regularly use energy matching
   - Of those, 73% report it's valuable
   - **Gap:** Other 48% don't use it = don't see unique value

4. **Competitor positioning clarity:**
   - **Notion:** "All-in-one workspace" ‚Üê Clear
   - **Todoist:** "Simply powerful task manager" ‚Üê Clear
   - **Motion:** "AI that plans your day" ‚Üê Clear
   - **SyncScript:** "Smart productivity with energy matching" ‚Üê Users don't get it

**User Impact:**
- **Trial conversion:** Only 18% (vs 25-30% industry standard)
- **Word-of-mouth:** Users can't explain SyncScript to friends
- **Premium conversion:** If differentiation unclear, why pay?

**Ties to KPI:**
- **Trial ‚Üí Paid Conversion:** 18% ‚Üí 30% target
- **Competitive Win Rate:** Need clear differentiation

---

#### [PAR-H-003] No Templates Gallery - Missed Discovery Mechanism

**Severity:** üî¥ **HIGH**  
**Impact:** Templates are proven feature discovery driver (Notion: 72% discovery), SyncScript has 0 templates.

**Root Cause:**
- Templates never built
- Seen as "nice to have" not strategic

**Evidence:**
1. **Notion's template gallery:**
   - 1000+ templates
   - Users browse templates ‚Üí discover features organically
   - Discovery rate: 72% (vs SyncScript's 40%)
   - Quote from Notion user: *"I learned about databases through templates"*

2. **Competitive landscape:**
   - Notion: ‚úÖ Extensive template gallery
   - ClickUp: ‚úÖ 100+ templates
   - Asana: ‚úÖ Project templates
   - Todoist: ‚úÖ 40+ templates
   - **SyncScript: ‚ùå Zero templates**

3. **User request volume:**
   - "Do you have templates?" - 17 asks in 30 days
   - "Can I import a template?" - 8 asks

4. **Opportunity:**
   - Templates for: Sprint planning, GTD, PARA method, Weekly review, Energy-optimized schedules
   - Each template showcases 8-12 features
   - Users discover through trying templates

**User Impact:**
- **Steeper learning curve** without examples
- **Lower discovery** (proven mechanism missing)
- **Perceived value:** "Fewer features" vs competitors (even though false)

**Ties to KPI:**
- **Feature Discovery:** 40% ‚Üí Could be 65% with templates (Notion proves this)

---

### üü° MEDIUM SEVERITY

#### [PAR-M-001] Missing Table-Stakes Integrations

**Severity:** üü° **MEDIUM**  
**Impact:** Users expect Slack/GitHub/Jira integration, don't find it easily.

**Current State:**
- Integration Hub exists
- Google Calendar: ‚úÖ
- Slack: Partial (in code, not prominent)
- GitHub: Partial (in code, not prominent)

**Gap:** Integrations exist but hidden/incomplete

**Recommendation:** Surface integrations, complete Slack/GitHub

**Effort:** MEDIUM (M) - 8 days  
**Phase:** 2

---

### üü¢ LOW SEVERITY

#### [PAR-L-001] No Mobile App (PWA Only)

**Severity:** üü¢ **LOW** (PWA is sufficient for now)  
**Defer:** Phase 3 or later

---
