### **P3-001: Feature Grid Gap Variance at 1024px** [VIRE-001]

**Page:** /features  
**Effort:** 2 hours  
**Sprint:** Post-Launch Polish

**Description:**
At 1024px viewport, feature card grid has 22px gap on left, 24px gap on right (2px variance due to container math).

**Impact:** 
- **Visibility:** Low (only at one specific breakpoint)
- **Frequency:** Rare (1024px landscape tablet)
- **User Affected:** < 5% of users

**Fix Complexity:** Simple (CSS media query adjustment)

**Recommendation:** Fix in V1.1 release

---

### **P3-002: Emblem Pulse Stutter on Slow Devices** [VIRE-002]

**Page:** /dashboard  
**Effort:** 4 hours  
**Sprint:** Performance Optimization Sprint

**Description:**
On devices with 4x CPU throttle, emblem pulse animation drops to ~45fps instead of 60fps due to conic-gradient recalculation.

**Impact:**
- **Visibility:** Low (only on very slow devices)
- **Frequency:** Rare (< 2% of users on low-end devices)
- **User Affected:** Minimal, still functional

**Fix Options:**
1. Add `will-change: transform` (2hr)
2. Pre-render as image (4hr)
3. Simplify gradient (1hr)

**Recommendation:** Option 1 in Performance Sprint

---

### **P3-003: Calendar Spacing Tight at 320px** [VIRE-003]

**Page:** /calendar  
**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Sprint:** Mobile Polish Sprint

**Description:**
At 320px (iPhone SE), calendar grid has 6px gaps instead of ideal 8px. Still legible and functional, just slightly cramped.

**Impact:**
- **Visibility:** Medium (noticeable at 320px)
- **Frequency:** Low (320px is 3-5% of mobile traffic)
- **User Affected:** ~ 2% of total users

**Fix:** Reduce font size slightly or accept 6px gaps at this extreme

**Recommendation:** Low priority, functional as-is
