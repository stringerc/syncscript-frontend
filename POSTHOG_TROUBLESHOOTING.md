# 🔧 POSTHOG TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

**Issue:** PostHog not showing events in dashboard  
**Status:** Enhanced debugging added ✅

---

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING STEPS**

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
Vercel is deploying your changes. Wait for the deployment to complete.

### Step 2: Hard Refresh Dashboard
1. **Visit:** https://www.syncscript.app/dashboard
2. **Hard refresh:** Press `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
3. **Open Developer Tools:** Press F12
4. **Go to Console tab**

### Step 3: Check Console Messages
**You should see:**
```
🎯 Initializing PostHog with key: phc_Anrd6x...
🎯 PostHog initialized successfully!
🎯 PostHog instance: [object]
🎯 Test event sent to PostHog
```

**If you see:**
```
⚠️ PostHog not initialized: {window: true, hasKey: false, key: undefined...}
```
**Then:** Environment variable issue

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES**

### Issue 1: Environment Variable Not Loaded
**Symptoms:** Console shows `hasKey: false`

**Fix:**
1. **Check Vercel Environment Variables:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select: syncscript-frontend project
   - Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
   - Verify: `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` exists
   - Value: `phc_Anrd6xXFlVMHoIN5Kfwkl3W7PcYov9bf252ytczqqtE`

2. **Redeploy:**
   - After adding env var, trigger a new deployment
   - Or push a small change to trigger deployment

### Issue 2: PostHog Project Settings
**Symptoms:** Events not appearing in PostHog dashboard

**Check:**
1. **Go to:** https://app.posthog.com
2. **Verify Project:** Make sure you're in the right project
3. **Check API Key:** Should match what we're using
4. **Look for:** "Live Events" or "Events" section

### Issue 3: Network Issues
**Symptoms:** Console shows PostHog initialized but no events

**Check:**
1. **Open Network tab** in Developer Tools
2. **Look for:** Requests to `app.posthog.com`
3. **Should see:** POST requests with event data
4. **If blocked:** Check ad blockers or firewall

## 🔧 **MANUAL TEST**

### Test PostHog Directly
1. **Open Console** in Developer Tools
2. **Run this command:**
```javascript
posthog.capture('manual_test_event', {test: true})
```
3. **Should see:** Event in PostHog dashboard within 30 seconds

### Test Environment Variable
1. **Open Console** in Developer Tools
2. **Run this command:**
```javascript
console.log('PostHog Key:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY)
```
3. **Should see:** Your API key (or undefined if not loaded)
