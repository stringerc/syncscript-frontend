- **Deliverables:** Risk register, security posture scorecard

### 2) Deputy CISO / Director of Security Engineering
- **Role:** Turns strategy into roadmaps; enforces technical standards
- **Focus:** Technical implementation of security controls

### 3) Chief Trust & Privacy Officer (CTPO)
- **Role:** Unifies privacy, ethics, and data governance
- **Responsibility:** DPIAs, consent management, data retention policies

### 4) VP, Resilience & Business Continuity
- **Role:** Crisis management, continuity planning, disaster recovery
- **Focus:** Geo redundancy, business continuity planning

## Non-Negotiable Technical Controls

### Zero-Trust by Default
- No standing admin access
- Just-In-Time (JIT) access with approvals and recording
- Device posture verification

### Secrets Management
- All secrets vaulted & rotated
- No plaintext secrets in code or CI variables
- Automated secret rotation

### Build Security
- Signed, reproducible builds
- Artifact verification before deploy (Cosign/Sigstore)
- SBOM for all artifacts

### Network Security
- Network egress allowlists from workloads
- DNS logging & egress broker
- Micro-segmentation

### Logging & Monitoring
- Immutable logging (WORM/lock retention)
- Log integrity checks
- Comprehensive telemetry

### Resilience
- Kill-switches & feature flags for rapid risk reduction
- Monthly backup testing (table + full restore)
- Isolated, immutable backup copies

## Operating Cadence

### Daily
- SOC stand-up (top alerts)
- Vulnerability triage
- PR security queue review

### Twice Weekly
- Purple team lab sessions
- Convert red insights to detections/controls

### Weekly
- Posture review (MTTD/MTTR, patch SLAs, guardrail drifts)
- Security metrics review

### Monthly
- Executive tabletop or live-fire exercises
- Backup restore drill
- Third-party risk review
- Security training updates

### Quarterly
- External red team or bounty sprint
- Crisis communications dry-run
- Policy refresh
- Chaos security games

## Proof of Effectiveness

### Ship Gates (Must Be Green)
- **Incidents:** No open criticals; MTTD < 10 min, MTTR < 2 hrs for P1
- **CI/CD:** 100% signed builds; 0 unsigned images in production
- **Identity:** 100% MFA, 0 standing admin, quarterly access reviews
- **AppSec:** 100% repos with SAST/DAST/Secrets scanning; 0 critical defect escapes
- **Cloud:** ‚â•95% CIS pass; ‚â•90% auto-remediation success
- **Data:** Encryption verified; deletion SLA met; DLP alerts triaged < 24h
- **Supply Chain:** SBOM for all artifacts; critical dependency patches ‚â§ 7 days

## Never Events (Zero Tolerance)
1. Plain-text secrets anywhere
2. Long-lived admin access
3. Unsigned/unattested deployments
4. Internet-reachable data stores
5. Missing authentication/authorization logs
6. No kill-switch for risky features
7. Unverified backups/restores
8. Untracked third-party data flows
9. AI features without safety evaluations
10. Repeat of the same root-cause incident

## 12-Month Maturity Roadmap

### Q1: Foundation
- Zero-Trust device posture
- Secrets lifecycle automation
- Golden-path application templates

### Q2: Advanced Detection
- Deception grid (canaries/honeytokens)
- Full AI red/eval suite
- Managed detection for SaaS sprawl

### Q3: Innovation
