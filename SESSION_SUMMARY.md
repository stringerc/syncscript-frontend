## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS**

### What's Working:
1. **Systematic approach** following GERC review plan
2. **Clear checkpoints** with measurable outcomes
3. **Comprehensive token system** covers all design needs

### What's Challenging:
1. **Scale** - 84 CSS files need token replacement
2. **Time** - Each blocker is 12-40 hours
3. **Coordination** - Need to update many files consistently

### Recommendations:
1. **Batch the work** - Replace all colors at once using find/replace
2. **Test frequently** - Check components after changes
3. **Stay focused** - One blocker at a time, red blockers first
