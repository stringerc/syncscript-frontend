## 💡 TIPS FOR TOMORROW

1. **Don't panic** - Finding issues is the POINT of audits
2. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Fix critical first, polish later
3. **One thing at a time** - Don't try to fix everything at once
4. **Celebrate findings** - Each issue found is one less in production
5. **Update your score** - Be honest about where you really are
