# ‚úÖ Context-Aware Planning Checklist
**Domain:** Context Intelligence  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Ensure world-class context-aware features (leave-by, weather, ETA)

---

## üéØ **LEAVE-BY CALCULATIONS**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Leave-by time calculated for all events with location
- [ ] Calculation includes:
  - [ ] Event start time
  - [ ] User's current/home location
  - [ ] Selected travel mode (car/transit/walk/bike)
  - [ ] Real-time traffic conditions
  - [ ] Historical travel time data (time-of-day patterns)
  - [ ] User's buffer preference (cautious: +15min, normal: +5min, aggressive: +0min)
- [ ] Confidence level shown (e.g., "85% confident arrival 3:00-3:10pm")
- [ ] Updates automatically when:
  - [ ] Traffic conditions change (>5min impact)
  - [ ] Event time edited
  - [ ] Location changed
  - [ ] Weather becomes severe

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Leave-by chip visible without scrolling (above fold)
- [ ] Shown as: "Leave by 2:25pm" (not "in 45 minutes")
- [ ] Includes travel mode icon (üöó üöá üö∂ üö¥)
- [ ] Tappable to show calculation breakdown
- [ ] Color coded: Green (plenty of time), Yellow (tight), Red (late)
- [ ] Works in: Calendar view, List view, Event details, Notifications

### Notifications
- [ ] Push notification at leave-by time
- [ ] Early warning option: 5min / 10min / 15min before
- [ ] "Leave now" notification if traffic worsens
- [ ] Silent hours respected (no 3am "leave by" alerts)

### Offline Behavior
- [ ] Uses last known traffic data
- [ ] Shows "Offline - using cached data" indicator
- [ ] Syncs when connection restored
- [ ] Still calculates basic ETA without traffic

---

## üå¶Ô∏è **WEATHER INTEGRATION**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Weather shown for event location at event time
- [ ] Includes: Icon, Temp, Conditions, Precipitation %
- [ ] Severe weather triggers warning badge
- [ ] Weather impacts travel time (rain: +10%, snow: +25%)
- [ ] Updates every 30min (or when forecast changes significantly)

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Weather icon inline with event (not hidden in menu)
- [ ] Tap for detailed forecast (next 4 hours)
- [ ] Severe weather shown prominently (‚ö†Ô∏è icon)
- [ ] Color coded: Sunny/Cloudy (neutral), Rain (blue), Snow (blue), Extreme (red)
- [ ] Works in all views (calendar, list, details)

### Smart Recommendations
- [ ] Outdoor event + rain forecast ‚Üí "Bring umbrella" or "Reschedule?"
- [ ] Extreme weather ‚Üí "Consider indoor alternative"
- [ ] Temperature extremes ‚Üí Clothing suggestions (optional)
- [ ] Weather-appropriate activity suggestions

### Privacy
- [ ] Weather API doesn't receive personal data
- [ ] Location used for weather only (not stored)
- [ ] User can disable weather features

---

## üìç **ETA RELIABILITY**

### Accuracy Requirements
- [ ] ETA within ¬±5min for 85%+ of events
- [ ] ETA within ¬±10min for 95%+ of events
- [ ] Confidence band shown (e.g., "Arrive 3:00-3:10pm")
- [ ] Historical accuracy visible ("Usually accurate within 7min")
- [ ] Learn from past events (user often runs 5min late?)

### Real-Time Updates
- [ ] ETA updates every 5min during active travel
- [ ] Shows current location on map (if permissions granted)
- [ ] Recalculates if user deviates from route
- [ ] Notification if ETA becomes late

### Multi-Modal Support
- [ ] Car: Traffic, accidents, road closures
- [ ] Transit: Real-time schedules, delays, strikes
- [ ] Walk: Weather, route obstacles
- [ ] Bike: Bike lanes, elevation, weather
- [ ] Rideshare: Estimated wait time + travel

### Integration
- [ ] One-tap to Google Maps / Apple Maps / Waze
- [ ] Route sent to navigation app with context
- [ ] Returns to SyncScript after navigation
- [ ] Tracks actual arrival time for learning

---

## üåç **TIME ZONE HANDLING**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Auto-detects user's current time zone
- [ ] Events show time in user's TZ by default
- [ ] Events in different TZ show both:
  - "3:00pm (5:00pm local)" for clarity
- [ ] Calendar sync handles TZ conversions
- [ ] No ambiguous times (always includes TZ or "local")

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Traveling across time zones: Events update
- [ ] DST transitions: Times adjust automatically
- [ ] International events: Clear which TZ
- [ ] Recurring events: TZ locked to original

---

## üîå **OFFLINE-FIRST DESIGN**

### Core Requirements
- [ ] All context features work offline
- [ ] Last known weather/traffic cached
- [ ] Leave-by calculated with cached data
- [ ] "Offline" indicator shown clearly
- [ ] Syncs automatically when online
- [ ] No data loss during offline period

### Performance
- [ ] Offline mode: <50ms calculations
- [ ] Background sync: <2s when reconnected
- [ ] IndexedDB used for local cache
- [ ] Cache expires after 6 hours (stale data)

---

## ‚ôø **ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG 2.1 AA)**

### Screen Reader Support
- [ ] Leave-by time announced: "Leave by 2:25pm for 3:00pm event"
- [ ] Weather announced: "Rainy, 65 degrees, 80% precipitation"
- [ ] ETA updates announced via ARIA live region
- [ ] All icons have text alternatives

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab to leave-by chip
- [ ] Enter to expand details
- [ ] Escape to close
- [ ] All controls keyboard accessible

### Visual
- [ ] Color contrast ‚â•4.5:1 (text)
- [ ] Weather icons work in grayscale
- [ ] Focus indicators visible
- [ ] Text resizable to 200%

---

## üìä **PERFORMANCE BUDGETS**

### Timing
- [ ] Leave-by calculation: <100ms
- [ ] Weather API call: <500ms (cached 30min)
- [ ] ETA calculation: <200ms

### Instrumentation
```javascript
// Leave-by displayed
track('leave_by_displayed', { 
  eventId, 
  confidence, 
  travelMode, 
  bufferMin 
});

// User departed
track('user_departed', { 
  eventId, 
  onTime: boolean,
  minutesEarly: number 
});

// User arrived
track('user_arrived', { 
  eventId, 
  onTime: boolean,
  actualDelay: number,
  etaAccuracy: number 
});

// Weather warning shown
track('weather_warning_shown', {
