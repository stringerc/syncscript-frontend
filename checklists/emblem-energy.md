## ‚ö° **RPE (RATE OF PERCEIVED EXERTION) CAPTURE**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User can log energy level 1-5 anytime
- [ ] Visual scale clear: 1 (exhausted) ‚Üí 5 (energized)
- [ ] Quick access: FAB, header widget, voice command
- [ ] Prompts at key moments:
  - [ ] Morning (daily energy baseline)
  - [ ] After task completion
  - [ ] Before energy-intensive tasks
  - [ ] When energy significantly changed (detected)
- [ ] Historical energy visible (chart over time)

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Energy picker: Large, tappable buttons (1-5)
- [ ] Visual feedback: Emoji/color for each level
- [ ] One-tap logging (no confirmation needed)
- [ ] Toast confirms: "Energy logged as 3 ‚ö°"
- [ ] Undo option (5 seconds)
- [ ] Works offline

### Timing
- [ ] Energy log takes <2 seconds start to finish
- [ ] No multi-step process
- [ ] Available from any screen
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut: E key opens energy picker

---

## üîÑ **INSTANTANEOUS ENERGY RECALIBRATION**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Completing a task updates user's energy instantly
- [ ] Recalibration based on:
  - [ ] Task energy requirement
  - [ ] Task outcome (success/struggle)
  - [ ] Time spent vs. estimated
  - [ ] User's feedback (if provided)
- [ ] New energy level calculated <200ms
- [ ] Next task suggestions update immediately

### Recalibration Math
```
Energy After = min(5, max(1, 
  Current Energy 
  + (Task Outcome Bonus: ¬±0.5)
  + (Flow State Bonus: +0.5 if completed quickly)
  - (Struggle Penalty: -0.5 if took 2x estimated time)
  - (Depletion: -0.2 per 30min elapsed)
))
```

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Energy change animated (e.g., 3 ‚Üí 4)
- [ ] Explanation shown: "Task boosted your energy +1"
- [ ] Emblem charge also updates (linked)
- [ ] Feels instant (<200ms total)
- [ ] Works even offline (syncs later)

### Validation
- [ ] Recalibration accurate within ¬±0.5 for 90% of completions
- [ ] Users trust the recalibration (survey: >80% agree "feels right")
- [ ] No gaming detected (e.g., marking easy tasks to boost energy)

---

## üèÜ **EMBLEM CHARGE MATH & ANTI-GAMING**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Completing tasks charges emblem by amount based on:
  - [ ] Task priority (1-5)
  - [ ] Task energy requirement (1-5)
  - [ ] Streak multiplier (1x - 3x)
  - [ ] Perfect match bonus (+20% if energy matched)
- [ ] Emblem levels up at thresholds (100, 250, 500, 1000 charge)
- [ ] Visual progress: Charge bar fills, particle effects on completion

### Charge Formula
```
Charge = (
  Base: Priority √ó 10
  + Energy Match: Requirement √ó 5
  + Streak Bonus: Current_Streak √ó 2
  + Perfect Match: +20% if user_energy == requirement
  - Gaming Penalty: -50% if suspicious pattern detected
)
```

### Anti-Gaming Measures
- [ ] Rapid-fire completions (<30s apart): Reduced charge
- [ ] Suspiciously easy tasks (always energy 1): Capped charge
- [ ] Pattern detection: Multiple undo/redo: Flagged
- [ ] Cooldown: Max 10 charges per 5min (prevents spam)
- [ ] Audit trail: All charge events logged for review

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Charge amount shown on completion: "+25‚ö° (Level 7: 487/500)"
- [ ] Visual celebration: Particle burst, emblem glows
- [ ] Level-up animation when threshold crossed
- [ ] Emblem visible in header (always)
- [ ] Tap emblem to see:
  - [ ] Current level + next threshold
  - [ ] Charge breakdown (this week)
  - [ ] Comparison to last week

---

## üìà **WEEKLY ENERGY INSIGHTS**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Weekly summary every Sunday evening
- [ ] Insights include:
  - [ ] Energy patterns (best time of day: 10am-12pm)
  - [ ] Completion rate by energy level
  - [ ] Energy-matched vs mismatched completions
  - [ ] Productivity score (energy-matched completion rate)
  - [ ] Recommendations for next week
- [ ] Visual: Energy heatmap (day √ó hour grid)

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Weekly review modal (dismissible)
- [ ] Also accessible from Analytics
- [ ] Shareable image (social proof)
- [ ] Actionable insights: "Schedule high-energy tasks at 10am"
- [ ] Historical comparison: Better/worse than last week

### Privacy
- [ ] Insights stay on device
- [ ] User controls sharing
- [ ] Can disable weekly summaries

## üéØ **ENERGY-MATCHED TASK SUGGESTIONS**

### Core Functionality
- [ ] AI suggests tasks based on current energy
- [ ] Energy 1-2: Suggests low-energy tasks (email, reading)
- [ ] Energy 3: Suggests medium tasks (meetings, planning)
- [ ] Energy 4-5: Suggests high-energy tasks (coding, creative work)
- [ ] Re-suggests when energy changes
- [ ] Learns from user acceptance/rejection

### Suggestion Quality
- [ ] Accuracy: >80% of accepted suggestions match energy
- [ ] Relevance: >70% of suggestions are due today/urgent
- [ ] Diversity: Not just easy tasks when low energy
- [ ] Timing: Refreshes every 30min OR on energy change

### UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] Suggestions shown prominently on dashboard
- [ ] Energy match badge: "Matched to your energy 3"
- [ ] Explain why: "You have medium energy, this task needs medium effort"
- [ ] One-tap accept
- [ ] One-tap reject (with reason: "Not now", "Wrong energy", "Not relevant")
- [ ] Feedback improves future suggestions
