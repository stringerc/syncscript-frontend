## DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### Daily: Should I Ship This?

✅ **Ship if:**
- Build passes
- No critical errors
- Warnings acceptable
- Feature works in dev
- Quick fix if breaks

❌ **Don't ship if:**
- Build fails
- Critical a11y issue
- Security vulnerability
- Data loss risk
- No rollback plan

### Weekly: What Should I Build?

**Priority Formula:**
```
Priority = (Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

**Impact:** 1-10 (how much it moves metrics)  
**Confidence:** 0-1 (how sure we are)  
**Effort:** 1-10 (time/complexity)

**Example:**
- Analytics: (9 × 0.9) / 3 = 2.7 ⭐ HIGH
- Fix typo: (2 × 1.0) / 1 = 2.0
- New feature: (7 × 0.6) / 8 = 0.5

### Monthly: What Should I Focus On?

**The 3 Lenses:**
1. **Users:** What do they need most?
2. **Business:** What drives growth/revenue?
3. **Quality:** What's most broken?

Pick 1 from each lens.

### Quarterly: Should I Pivot?

**Pivot if:**
- Metrics flat for 2+ months despite effort
- User churn > growth
- Market shifted dramatically
- Better opportunity identified
- Founder burnout imminent

**Don't pivot if:**
- One bad week
- Competitor launched similar
- Feeling impatient
- Not enough data yet

## CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT LOOP

### Monthly Improvement Ritual

1. **Identify Top 3 Pain Points**
   - From metrics (drop-offs)
   - From user feedback (common complaints)
   - From your own usage (dogfood)

2. **Fix One Completely**
   - Not band-aid, real fix
   - Measure before/after
   - Validate with users

3. **Document Learning**
   - What was the issue?
   - What fixed it?
   - What can we reuse?

**Result:** Every month, one significant improvement validated by data.

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

   - Start incident log

2. **Short-term** (5-60 min)
   - Identify root cause
   - Implement fix
   - Test fix thoroughly
   - Redeploy

3. **Follow-up** (1-48 hrs)
   - Post-mortem document

---

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

**You'll know the operating rhythm is working when:**

1. ✅ You ship consistently (weekly)
2. ✅ You make data-driven decisions
3. ✅ You catch issues before users do
4. ✅ You feel in control (not reactive)
5. ✅ You improve systematically
6. ✅ You don't burn out
7. ✅ Quality stays high
8. ✅ Users are happy

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Start Small
Don't try to implement everything at once. Start with:
1. **Daily commits** (build the habit)
2. **Weekly planning** (Friday afternoon)
3. **Monthly metrics review** (first Monday)

### Add Gradually
Once rhythms feel natural:
1. Add mid-week checkpoints
2. Add monthly OKRs
3. Add quarterly planning

### Stay Flexible
Adapt the rhythm to your reality:
- Some weeks will be chaotic (that's OK)
- Some months will focus on one thing (that's OK)
- The rhythm serves you, not vice versa

---

## THE LEGENDARY DIFFERENCE

**Good founders:** Ship features.  
**Great founders:** Ship features that work.  
**Legendary founders:** Ship features that work, measure impact, iterate based on data, and build systematic quality.

**You're aiming for legendary.** 🚀

This operating rhythm is how you get there.
