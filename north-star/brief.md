## Vision

Transform SyncScript from a feature-rich productivity platform into the world's most **intuitive, context-aware, energy-matched productivity companion** that users can't imagine living without.

---

## Strategic Goals

### Primary (Next 90 Days)
1. **Achieve energy-matched completion dominance** - users complete tasks matched to their energy 90% of the time
2. **Become context-aware** - users never miss events due to traffic/weather/timing
3. **Enable budget-conscious planning** - users stay under budget 80% of the time
4. **Perfect energy recalibration** - completing a task instantly and accurately updates user energy

### Secondary (Supporting)
5. **Increase feature discovery** from 40% to 75%
6. **Maintain accessibility leadership** (WCAG 2.1 AA â†’ WCAG 2.2 AA)
7. **Achieve industry-best performance** (maintain 96+ Lighthouse score)
